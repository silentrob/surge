_surge_ is a Command Line Interface that runs on the nodejs runtime (surge's only external dependency). Surge can be installed using npm (via `sudo npm install -g surge`). Once installed, `surge` is available from within your terminal. The following command will deploy the current working directory to the surge servers where the application will be available at sintaxi.com.

    $ surge ./ sintaxi.com

Run `surge --help` to see the following overview of the `surge` command...

## CDN Features

- Custom CNAME and custom SSL

If youâ€™re using tools like Grunt, Gulp, or a static site generator like Jekyll, your files are output into a compile directory like `_site/`, `build/`, or `www/`. From the root of your project, pass Surge the path to this directory to upload your compiled assets.

    surge www

You may also add this directory to your `.gitignore` to keep your compiled assets out of your Git history.
